    Please note that the date format is not strictly adhered to in this example (it's a mix of month/day/year and day/month/year). In real-world scenarios, you would expect dates to be consistently formatted as either MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY. 
    Also, please note that there are some extra characters at the end of the receipt text which seem out of place. These have been ignored in this example.
