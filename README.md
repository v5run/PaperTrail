# PaperTrail!

This project aims to create a powerful, user-friendly tool that helps individuals track and analyze their spending habits. By leveraging advanced technologies like image recognition and AI parsing, this application transforms receipt data into actionable financial insights.

## Key Features

1. **Receipt Analysis**

   - Upload pictures of your purchases or receipts.
   - Extract relevant details such as date, total amount, and itemized list.

2. **AI Integration**

   - Integrates GPT4All to enhance parsing and provide meaningful insights from the extracted data.
   - Identifies spending patterns and suggests budgeting improvements.

3. **Visualizations**

   - Generates charts and graphs for a clear view of your expenses.
   - Categorizes expenses to help identify areas for savings.

4. **Personalized Budgeting**

   - Allows users to set financial goals.
   - Provides personalized recommendations based on spending habits.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML & CSS.
- **Backend**: Python (with Flask for deployment).
- **Machine Learning**: OpenCV for image recognition and GPT4All for AI parsing.
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage & AWS S3 for image storage.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Receipts**: Users can upload images of receipts directly through the application.
2. **Data Extraction**: Using OpenCV, the system extracts text and relevant information from the receipt images.
3. **Parsing with AI**: GPT4All parses the extracted text to classify and analyze expenses.
4. **Insights and Recommendations**: The application presents clear visual insights and provides personalized budgeting advice.
5. **Storage:** The images are forwarded to an Amazon S3 storage bucket, and the contents of the receipt are stored in a PostgreSQL database, tied to specific users.
